### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `PLANNING_UI.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.

- **Check `TASK_UI.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING_UI.md

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK_UI.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK_UI.md` under a “Discovered During Work” section.

### 📎 Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified the packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.



- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK_UI.md`.
