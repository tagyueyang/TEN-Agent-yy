# Project Planning

## High-Level Direction

The goal of this project is to enhance the existing React web portal for Ten-Agent-yy project, a real-time conversational AI agent. The enhancements will focus on improving user experience, and optimizing performance.

## Scope

- **User Interface (UI) Enhancements**: Improve the visual design and usability of the portal.
<!-- - **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the portal runs smoothly and efficiently, even under high load. -->

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TypeScript, Next.js 15
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebRTC, Socket.io
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, Gemini 2.0 Live
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Current Structure

- **Component Organization**: All UI components are grouped by feature in `src/components/` (e.g., `Chat`, `Agent`, `Button`, `Layout`, etc.), supporting modular development and easy enhancement.
- **App Directory**: Uses Next.js 13+ app directory structure (`src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/layout.tsx`).
- **Supporting Code**: Additional folders for state management (`store`), shared logic (`common`, `lib`), types, assets, and protocol buffers.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui are used for consistent, modern UI design.
- **Development Workflow**: Uses pnpm for package management and provides clear local development instructions in the README.

## Success Metrics

- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback and increased user engagement.
<!-- - **Performance Metrics**: Reduced load times and improved responsiveness. -->
