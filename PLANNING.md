## High-Level Direction

### Scope

The goal is to create a new extension `epe_python` using Python under the Ten-Agent-yy project. This extension will enhance the capabilities of the existing framework by adding new functionalities or improving existing ones.

### Technologies

- **Python**: Primary language for developing the extension.
- **TEN Framework**: Core framework for building and integrating the extension.
- **OpenAI API**: For conversational capabilities.
- **RTC**: Real-time communication.
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment.

### Objectives

1. **Understand Existing Framework**: Analyze the current structure and components of the Ten-Agent-yy project.
2. **Define Extension Requirements**: Identify the specific functionalities and requirements for the `epe_python` extension.
3. **Develop Extension**: Implement the extension using Python.
4. **Integrate and Test**: Ensure seamless integration with the existing framework and perform thorough testing.

## Initial Tasks

1. **Setup Development Environment**: Install necessary tools and dependencies.
2. **Analyze `property.json`**: Understand the configurations and interactions defined in the file.
3. **Define Extension Structure**: Plan the structure and components of the `epe_python` extension.
4. **Implement Core Features**: Develop the core functionalities of the extension.
5. **Integrate with TEN Framework**: Ensure the extension works smoothly within the existing framework.
6. **Testing and Debugging**: Perform testing and debugging to ensure reliability and performance.
